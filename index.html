        <p>
            Hello! I'm a student in the Hackathon Club, learning how to code and
            build apps.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I really like coding because it seems very cool and interesting. I
            saw that there was a hackathon club and I really wanted to join. Now
            that I joined this club, I have learned a lot of skills.
        </p>

        <h2>My Skills</h2>
        <p>I can make basic HTML code with a little bit of CSS.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>My Dream Project</h2>
        <p>
            I really want to make a fully functioning website. I want to fully
            learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so I can make it the way I want.

            <h2>My Hackathon Idea</h2>
            <p>
                I would like to create an app so students can suggest any type
                of idea so that it can be implemented in the school.
